Gave off the same vibes like when I biked at night
After 7/11 we went back and just hung around until like 5:30 and then it was sunrise! So we all went and took pics and drove around to look at the sunrise which was vibes
Then we went back to Christina’s and slept at like 6:30 and I woke up at at 9:30 so I only got like 3 hours of sleep 🤠

Kinda sad abt xc ending😐 but we won’t talk abt that
Today we played ULTIMATE FRISBEE but it didn’t go as hard as last year but that’s ok
Also it’s crazy to think how we only have 1 more year of xc and IM GONNA MISS ALL THE SENIORS especially my bae @sylvienajarian
The sunset was super nice today and I’m gna miss all the talks and awkward rap battles
Also @reilly.prendergast WHAT A SIDE PROFILE
So until next year xc 😢
DAY 4: It was my first time sautéing onions and @_thomasbarlow made fun of me but I was proud of myself
Then Amelia and I went to drive around for good vibes and hung out in mark lane
We played soccer for 5 minutes and Amelia shoved me and we tried doing tricks
I DROVE A CAR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER AND DODNT KNOW THE CAR MOVED EVEN IF U DIDNT PRESS THE GAS and I did my first parking job
I think Amelia has a video of me driving but it was so bad but lowkey fun and scary
Then I went hiking (kind of) with @thomasdewitt__ and then got stack creamery and it was rlly nice and the sunset was super pretty today
I ALSO STRAIGHTENED MY HAIR FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH A STRAIGHTENER and yea
Now the weekend is over and I have to do homework :((
DAY 3: SAT DAY OMG
So my parents weren’t home this weekend and Amelia is literally my mom and picked me up at 7:20 just to drive me to nanuet high school and picked me up from the test as well
My brain was so fried after the test AND I MISSED BIDEN WINNING THE ELECTION
But Amelia caught me up as we left and as we were leaving we saw a donkey which was pretty cool
Then we got Burger King and then she drove me to work
Speaking of which I don’t work there anymore bc we kind of shut downnnnn
Anyways anelia and I have always had a plan to watch parasite and eat Korean food AND WE MADE IT HAPPEN
It was sm fun and we got donkatsu, topokki, and japchae and the food was amazing
Also Thomas came to see the movie and helped eat the food since we couldn’t finish it all and I paid for the meal bc Amelia was literally my mom the whole day and so I needed to do something in return
(Also my mom gave me money to pay for it oops) but it was a rlly fun night bc the movie was amazing and I brought my heated blanket which was rlly comfy as well
And Thomas got to watch the whole thing even tho he almost spoiled half of it but it was a good stress reliever from the SAT and work
DAY 2: went to get brunch with the my friends at Raymond’s and it was so expensive but thank you Sonia for charging ur card $104 so we didn’t have to figure out how everyone should chip in
And I got eggs Norwegian which is pretty much smoked salmon poached eggs and Hollandaise sauce with potatoes
It wasn’t amazing but pretty good and then we got boba at village tea shop which was amazing
I got mango with tapioca and lychee jelly and I never get mango milk tea and it was so so so so so amazing
I also took photos of random things and I rlly liked how they turned out and honestly it was rlly fun
After that I went back home to prepare for the SAT and literally slept at 8:30 which is the earliest I’ve slept in years
THIS FOUR DAY WEEKEND WAS SO MUCH FUN SO IN GNA DOCUMENT EACH DAY WITH A SEPARATE POST
Anyways on Thursday amelia and I went to get beets and shop and just saying bowls at beets are lowkey so bad
Then we went to see Thomas and Marco and play golf with them
Thomas made fun of my clubs even tho I just found them in my garage and Amelia was bad at golf in the beginning but then got reallllly good towards the middle and it was actually insane bc she could hit as far as the guys
Then we all went to kilwins to get hot chocolate but I can’t have milk so I had to get mine with water which tasted horrible
I also kinda burnt my tongue and it hurt the next day which was weird
And when we were drinking hot chocolate I got this amazing photo of Thomas 🤢But overall a vv fun day!!!!! And my shoulder hurts from playing which is so weird but now I have the form down 😎
Ok so I low key got snap back LMAOOO but I’m not gna be snapping too many ppl back and I stopped streaks n stuff
Anyways yesterday I ran near the reservoir and got some rlly nice views of the trees
I honestly didn’t know where I was going and and ended up at the shop rite in hillsdale but it was a pretty fun run
I ran 7 miles and didn’t realize but I did like a whole loop around Woodcliff lake and park ridge
It was like such a nice temperature to run in yesterday and yea AMAZING RUN
Day 2: I actually didn’t see @ssherryyangg today but I liked this photo and it was fun when we walked in the rain so I wanted to commemorate it with this post
Honestly kinda the same as yesterday but it wasn’t as bad bc I was super busy with work and then I had to take a practice SAT so it was a vv stressful day
I still don’t know what I’m gna be for Halloween or what I’m gna do🎃 sorry if I’m posting sm but if u don’t want to see it u can unfollow
@thomasdewitt__ was such a g and checked up on me which was amazing!! I also want to read a new book so pls comment any recs and if they’re bad I’m never talking to u again jk
Update: screen time is 5 hours so it is cut in half from Tuesday
It’s only day 1 of not having snap and the Snapchat withdrawal is vv bad
I don’t know how what to do besides go on insta which is kind of a problem
Also I feel like my communication was cut in half and I’m still procrastinating just as much as if I did have it so I’ll see if it gets better in a week
Also I’ll be documenting how I’m feeling here
I’ve been wanting to start my podcast but idk with who SO PLEASE LMK of ur interested in talking with me lmao AND ANybody pls text me 😢
Photo dump! I’m getting off snap for awhile so I’ll be posting more here
Some fun stuff I’ve taken/been doing the past few months!! I’m gonna try posting more on here so I can track what I’ve been doing during the past year
quarantine update!
Ok so pretty much I have this photo board in my bedroom and the last time I changed/added photos was when I first got it which was early middle school so it’s been a long time
So this time I wanted to change it to something aesthetically pleasing hehe and this literally took me hourssss but I put together my glossier, brandy Melville, urban outfitters, supreme, palace, and other stickers/merch and got this! Thanks to @soniabalanii and @amelia.jenningss for helping me lmaooo
Ok so anyways I sent my bulletin board to glossier AND THEY RESPONDED which was actually crazy
Also I’ve been FaceTiming Amelia a lot these days and Yao Lao shi wanted to zoom the honors classes in hills AND valley??? It’s was kinda awk tho since I wasn’t expecting that
Another thing that I did was help cut my brothers hair which was a rlly fun experience bc he kept on freaking out if I reacted in any way and also I’ve literally just been changing/cleaning my room so give me ideas on what I should do next!!
Part 2 :((
Currently missing them and this right about now!! I hate quarantine omg I didn’t realize how much I depended on human interaction
Love you guys so much ahhhh 🥺 (Katherine rlly inspired me lmao)
Honestly all I can say is that midterms were not the vibe.
A second a day for a whole year 2019! (Well actually 214 days but same thing)

A video of me singing bubble gum by clairo! I messed up a lot tho so might delete later

More life updates! Cross country just started and as everyone knows I’ve just been eating avocado for lunch and an apple bc I’m trying to be healthy
I kinda like freshman year better bc there were more ppl in my class but whatever
CHEM IS SO HARD IM ALREADY STRUGGLING
Anyways for xc I’ve been so tired everyday which isn’t good bc I’m sleeping early and eating right so I have to figure that out
Also if you haven’t known I’ve been taking ugly photos of everyone without them noticing so that’s fun
I also go around shouting in the hallway “OMG IS THAT @reilly.prendergast ARE U THE VARISTY XC STAR
CAN I GET A PHOTO” which is rlly fun bc it embarrasses her a lot
Also if my teeth are strangely blue it’s bc I ate a lollipop
Overall school has just been ok but I’m hoping it gets better
So yeah hope I can run 5 miles tomorrow without feeling like I can’t breathe
Ok yay bye
Heyo so yesterday was a rlly fun day bc I got to go to the city with my bro and we went for a Fordham tour
The college is actually rlly nice and it’s right in the city so if I ever went there it would be great
They had like moving bookcases and pretty nice dorms
And so anyways after the tour we went to Chinatown ofc and got Asian snacks and my brother and I got a family pack of crackers which is rlly funny bc it was a rlly big bag
We also went to the doctor to get my physical done and she gave me a flu shot which hurt so much and I was so scared bc I hate shots
So after that we did some shopping and we went to stadium goods, palace, and kith
And at stadium good there were a bunch of cameras and I was like are they shooting a sneaker shopping video?? But they weren’t and the real housewives were there and I was like awww but the worker told us that the celebrities usually go at like 8/9 pm to shoot the sneaker videos so I mean maybe for next time
We also went to canal street market and got bubble tea that was $7??? So that’s very expensive
We also went to kith and my brother got these shoes and when we were leaving my brother wanted to put shoes on his backpack and so we took the family size bag of crackers into the kith bag and the guard looked at us weirdly bc he didn’t know what it was and it was so funny
After shopping we then met up with Andrew go have dinner!! I saw him play handball which was pretty cool bc it’s kinda scary if you got it by one and then we went to the restaurant and the food was pretty gooooood
We then did some more shopping (mainly for my brother) and then we went to meet up with my parents and their friend since they were in the city
She was from London and it was rlly cool hearing her accent hehehe
So yea overall a pretty fun day besides the fact that we saw a man in the street with his pants like down to his butt blocking traffic
I mainly wrote this so I could remember it and yea
I miss camp so much 😭😭 but this year was great and I got closer with a lot more ppl
To my favorite Asians 💗💗
Love you guys so much and thanks for being there for me
To many more years/weeks of memories and couldn’t do life with you
Which ones
When you’re an avocado toast queen
Anyways gna miss the American food and today’s my last day her before Hong Kong and I’m gna be homesick
Possibly a vlog is on the way??? And yea

CAMP REUNIONNNNNNNNN!!!!! ❤❤❤❤
INSTA BADDIEEEE @bhadbhabie
ok guys sorry for spamming but i just thought of this
so for lunch my brother and i shared 7 eggs together and it wasnt like with other things
we just straight out had eggs with cheese and thats it
so anyways 7 eggs is a lot it like 90 calories per egg so in all we had 630? calories in eggs but its ok we split it
we used the rest of the eggs that were left in the carton
so heres the rationing behind it
this is what the dialogue was like but im not sure if its accurate.
my bro: "lets use the rest of the eggs"
me: "whAaT!? why thats too many eggs"
my bro: "not its not"
me: "im not hungry so i wont have that much"
my bro: "youre only eating 3 of them"
me: "why do we have to finish them"
my bro: "fine then well make 4"
me: "four is an unlucky number"
my bro: "exactly so if we have 5 then theyre gonna be 2 left so why dont we finish it"
me: "fine."
also the eggs turned out decent/not that good/ok
like a mix between good eggs and the scrambled eggs from camp
oh yeah the eggs we were making were scrambled if that adds to any of this irrational reasoning
yeah just wanted to tell you this
also to all the people who are like "oh i used to have 7 eggs when i was born and now i eat a dozen a day" well good for you thats a lot of eggs to me
so pretty much i took a bunch of rlly high quality photos on Lukas's nikon and im rlly impressed by how well some of them are bc i didnt rlly think of how good they were when i was taking them
so anyways im just gonna like caption some of the photos i took and like what type of effects i see in them
kinda like the vocab i learned abt photography in art last year.
so the first one is of 🅱onia and i thought this turned out rlly nice
as in like do you the reflection in her glasses and the blurred out background!?!? like wow its actually so nice
second is of sherry and even tho she always looks awful because her face looks like a pancake in this photo, it shows the texture of her skin
not to be weird or anything but look at how many pores she has
but she doesnt have any pimples so ????
third is of hilary again i like the blur effect and the high quality photo
i mainly thought that this was just funny oof.
ethan just wanted me to take a photo of him thinking hardly about absolutely nothing.
five is what i call actual art
jkjk i just spent like 20 minutes of my free period taking photos of ryans lunch
mainly his Doritos
but then again the texture and the high quality photo?!?!? also had to slowly eat the dorito in order for me to capture the moment
ikk vv weird im sorry
i was bored and had a very nice camera accessible
any other person would do that...
anyways the sixth one is actually cool
so you know in yeam how we learned abt Renaissance paintings
well it looked like i used chirascuro and stfumato (so light and darkness) on hilarys face
i think its a legit pic.
another close up of ryans Doritos
vv nice colors looks saturated but isnt
(its the artificial coloring)
and the texture and blur effect again.
is a nice photo of ethan (not really) its a self portrait or close up i forgot what its called but its called something in photography.
ok so yeah shoutout to everyone who read my dbq

Thank you for the stress you put @charlotte_scholze and I through when painting!! Also @ethan_spark18 give me those mints!! ☹️@bobross #weneedafanbrush
Thank you for this beautiful message @charlotte_scholze
Some sparklers and painting with this beauty @charlotte_scholze and we (mostly meaning myself) made a mess it was rlly bad oof
Bob Ross is great and we found out he named his child bob too so there are 2 bob Ross’s and it was my first time with sparklers which was great
Thought I was gonna burn my fingers but I didn’t which was pretty decent
The music you hear in the background is not heavy metal hahaha we were watching supernatural lol
And yea just an update of what I did on fridayyyy
Also you can hear my beautiful commentating in the background oof.
Ok so like I’ve been seeing this video of Paul Anka all over Instagram and I was looking thru my records and I FOUND THE SAME EXACT SONG so then I decided to recreate it so yay! And you should be proud of that perfect timing I did bc it’s great.
FINISH THE VINEEE
We’ve achieved greatness
We hate math (and chinese)
So Logan’s sister bit me and that was the most confusing moment of my life
Ok so The Hate U Give was so good
At first I was expecting that the movie was going to ruin the book but overall it was just as good as the book
Also the soundtrack was GREAT (Travis Scott!!) and at some points @ssherryyangg and I were like tearing up and it was so sad
Bc I usually don’t cry or tear up in movies but this one WAS SO SAD
So overall my favorite thing was the soundtrack and the casting was pretty good
So yeah thanks for my movie review I’m now a critic.
Absolute stunners @allyferner @_jess_huang
So if anybody has an old phone or is getting a new one and would like to give me their old one hmu

Yayyyyy!!!!! But like i bumped my head in a cabinet bc I was too excited
Ok so I know that this is late but I just wanted to appreciate this summer bc it was super fun (for the most part) from going to Florida and the summer nights in the city, it was rlly fun
I’m gonna miss the there and back trips from my shore house and the time spent with friends bc u guys make me so happy lol
Oh yea and that longgg month going to lifetime like everyday with @ssherryyangg and spending my bday with her bc my family wasn’t there so props to you
And then there was CAMPPPP
I srsly loved it this year and I met new ppl and got closer with the ones from the past year
I miss u guys so much and can’t wait for the reunion
From the late night calls with @eugene_shen_ @_jess_huang @winston.hsiao to the mini meet ups u guys have always cheered me up
And even tho this overlaps into the school year I met some rlly cool friends yesterday so yay!! And @billygoldd and @catie_mcguire_ we gotta see the Freddie Mercury movie bc I finally met ppl who like 80s music hahah
Oh and @lucas_spelled_w1th_a_k for buying 2 boxes of cereal and spilling it everywhere

HApPy bIrTHDay iSAbeL!!!! Love you 💕💕💗💗💗
I’ve been on the phone for abt 4 hours and 30 minutes because @eugene_shen_ @winston.hsiao @_jess_huang WONT LET ME SLEEP Btw it’s 4:25 rn
I finished the book and I DONT UNDERSTAND THE ENDING and how am I supposed to read this on a spiritual/3rd level bc I’m pretty much reading it on a literal level.
Some conspiracies for the ending:
He was also a ghost this whole time
He’s gonna get out and not kill the person because of the stories the rest of the people told
When he leaves he’s gonna join Shawn and the rest of the dead (almost like walking into the light ig????)
Or he actually is gonna kill Riggs because like Shawn was implying to follow him to kill Riggs when he says “you coming?” (Reynolds 306)
(which I don’t think he is)
Also I almost cried in some parts of the book it was rlly good so I recommend it even tho it was summer reading and it’s telling the story in poem form so it’s quick.
Hey guys so it’s currently 5:28am and I have to finish a gift for my friend because the party is today
But I’m procrastinating and o just read to all the boys I’ve loved before and watched the movie
Idk how I’m gonna finish bc I messed up on it and I hope he likes the gift tho
So anyways yeah just a life update because I’m procrastinating but I also rlly wanted to watch this movie but I also really wanted to finish the gift tonight
So bye
Update: I’m at my shore house too and the party was moved back to 1:30 so I have finish the gift in the carrrr
@masterchef againnnn #grindneverstops @winston.hsiao
what i see next to me after i take my test @mlokshin3
GUYS I JUST REALIZED THIS
Which one is ittt?? also almost posted this on my actual insta oof
100 SONGS IN RAPPP PLAYLISTTTTT
I HAVE BEEN IN LOVE WITH THIS SONG FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS AND IVE BEEN LISTENING TO IT NONSTOP
ok so friend appreciation post!! it might be long sooo
anyways the camp reunion was today and i was so happy
like me and @eugene_shen_ were running in to see everyone
i rlly love all my camp friends and im gonna miss them sm
they all bring out the best in me even tho we all insult each other oof
i love them sooo much and when its time to leave camp like forever im gonna cry so hard
i cant imagine life without them even tho we see each other like once a year
i honestly would skip any plans i had to be with them
it was so fun today and the most genuine fun i had in a while
as in like i can be myself and be comfortable around them
also i think @_jess_huang got me sick or i lost my voice today
ik were gonna drift apart again but i hope we see each other throughout the school year
cough cough @peter.dicaprio
im just rlly sad that today ended bc u guys r my best friends and i dont know what i would do w/o u all
even tho i can get annoyed but i always do i still love u all deep down hahah
also if other ppl wanted to know what i did i went rock climbing and i think i sprained my ankle by trying to kick matt but then trip over something so big oof
anyways yeah i just miss camp sm and everyone better come back next year!!
WAIT ALSO @allyferner MENTIONED THIS BUT I DO HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH PPL AT CAMP THAN PPL AT SCHOOL
AND WE BARELY SEE EACH OTHER BUT WE STILL HAVE A RLLY STRONG FRIENDSHIPPPP
CAMP REUNIONNNNNNNNN!!!!! ❤❤❤❤
INSTA BADDIEEEE @bhadbhabie
ok guys sorry for spamming but i just thought of this
so for lunch my brother and i shared 7 eggs together and it wasnt like with other things
we just straight out had eggs with cheese and thats it
so anyways 7 eggs is a lot it like 90 calories per egg so in all we had 630? calories in eggs but its ok we split it
we used the rest of the eggs that were left in the carton
so heres the rationing behind it
this is what the dialogue was like but im not sure if its accurate.
my bro: "lets use the rest of the eggs"
me: "whAaT!? why thats too many eggs"
my bro: "not its not"
me: "im not hungry so i wont have that much"
my bro: "youre only eating 3 of them"
me: "why do we have to finish them"
my bro: "fine then well make 4"
me: "four is an unlucky number"
my bro: "exactly so if we have 5 then theyre gonna be 2 left so why dont we finish it"
me: "fine."
also the eggs turned out decent/not that good/ok
like a mix between good eggs and the scrambled eggs from camp
oh yeah the eggs we were making were scrambled if that adds to any of this irrational reasoning
yeah just wanted to tell you this
also to all the people who are like "oh i used to have 7 eggs when i was born and now i eat a dozen a day" well good for you thats a lot of eggs to me
so pretty much i took a bunch of rlly high quality photos on Lukas's nikon and im rlly impressed by how well some of them are bc i didnt rlly think of how good they were when i was taking them
so anyways im just gonna like caption some of the photos i took and like what type of effects i see in them
kinda like the vocab i learned abt photography in art last year.
so the first one is of 🅱onia and i thought this turned out rlly nice
as in like do you the reflection in her glasses and the blurred out background!?!? like wow its actually so nice
second is of sherry and even tho she always looks awful because her face looks like a pancake in this photo, it shows the texture of her skin
not to be weird or anything but look at how many pores she has
but she doesnt have any pimples so ????
third is of hilary again i like the blur effect and the high quality photo
i mainly thought that this was just funny oof.
ethan just wanted me to take a photo of him thinking hardly about absolutely nothing.
five is what i call actual art
jkjk i just spent like 20 minutes of my free period taking photos of ryans lunch
mainly his Doritos
but then again the texture and the high quality photo?!?!? also had to slowly eat the dorito in order for me to capture the moment
ikk vv weird im sorry
i was bored and had a very nice camera accessible
any other person would do that...
anyways the sixth one is actually cool
so you know in yeam how we learned abt Renaissance paintings
well it looked like i used chirascuro and stfumato (so light and darkness) on hilarys face
i think its a legit pic.
another close up of ryans Doritos
vv nice colors looks saturated but isnt
(its the artificial coloring)
and the texture and blur effect again.
is a nice photo of ethan (not really) its a self portrait or close up i forgot what its called but its called something in photography.
ok so yeah shoutout to everyone who read my dbq
welcome to my ted talk, thank you for coming to my ted talk.
yo everybody comment ur numbers below bc my phone officially does not work oof
so pretty much we had a delayed opening today and last night i started a bob ross painting at twelve o'clock at night and i ended at 2:30

COSTUME OF THE FREAKING YEAR
Ughh I have to read this much and I have to do homework
Ppl hmu to hang on Saturday
I finished the book and I DONT UNDERSTAND THE ENDING and how am I supposed to read this on a spiritual/3rd level bc I’m pretty much reading it on a literal level.
Some conspiracies for the ending:
He was also a ghost this whole time
He’s gonna get out and not kill the person because of the stories the rest of the people told
When he leaves he’s gonna join Shawn and the rest of the dead (almost like walking into the light ig????)
Or he actually is gonna kill Riggs because like Shawn was implying to follow him to kill Riggs when he says “you coming?” (Reynolds 306)
(which I don’t think he is)
Also I almost cried in some parts of the book it was rlly good so I recommend it even tho it was summer reading and it’s telling the story in poem form so it’s quick.
Hey guys so it’s currently 5:28am and I have to finish a gift for my friend because the party is today

NYC photo dump !
Kinda sad abt xc ending😐 but we won’t talk abt that
Today we played ULTIMATE FRISBEE but it didn’t go as hard as last year but that’s ok
Also it’s crazy to think how we only have 1 more year of xc and IM GONNA MISS ALL THE SENIORS especially my bae @sylvienajarian
The sunset was super nice today and I’m gna miss all the talks and awkward rap battles
Also @reilly.prendergast WHAT A SIDE PROFILE
So until next year xc 😢
DAY 4: It was my first time sautéing onions and @_thomasbarlow made fun of me but I was proud of myself
Then Amelia and I went to drive around for good vibes and hung out in mark lane
We played soccer for 5 minutes and Amelia shoved me and we tried doing tricks
I DROVE A CAR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER AND DODNT KNOW THE CAR MOVED EVEN IF U DIDNT PRESS THE GAS and I did my first parking job
I think Amelia has a video of me driving but it was so bad but lowkey fun and scary
Then I went hiking (kind of) with @thomasdewitt__ and then got stack creamery and it was rlly nice and the sunset was super pretty today
I ALSO STRAIGHTENED MY HAIR FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH A STRAIGHTENER and yea
Now the weekend is over and I have to do homework :((
DAY 3: SAT DAY OMG
So my parents weren’t home this weekend and Amelia is literally my mom and picked me up at 7:20 just to drive me to nanuet high school and picked me up from the test as well
My brain was so fried after the test AND I MISSED BIDEN WINNING THE ELECTION
But Amelia caught me up as we left and as we were leaving we saw a donkey which was pretty cool
Then we got Burger King and then she drove me to work
Speaking of which I don’t work there anymore bc we kind of shut downnnnn
Anyways anelia and I have always had a plan to watch parasite and eat Korean food AND WE MADE IT HAPPEN
It was sm fun and we got donkatsu, topokki, and japchae and the food was amazing
Also Thomas came to see the movie and helped eat the food since we couldn’t finish it all and I paid for the meal bc Amelia was literally my mom the whole day and so I needed to do something in return
(Also my mom gave me money to pay for it oops) but it was a rlly fun night bc the movie was amazing and I brought my heated blanket which was rlly comfy as well
And Thomas got to watch the whole thing even tho he almost spoiled half of it but it was a good stress reliever from the SAT and work
DAY 2: went to get brunch with the my friends at Raymond’s and it was so expensive but thank you Sonia for charging ur card $104 so we didn’t have to figure out how everyone should chip in
And I got eggs Norwegian which is pretty much smoked salmon poached eggs and Hollandaise sauce with potatoes
It wasn’t amazing but pretty good and then we got boba at village tea shop which was amazing
I got mango with tapioca and lychee jelly and I never get mango milk tea and it was so so so so so amazing
I also took photos of random things and I rlly liked how they turned out and honestly it was rlly fun
After that I went back home to prepare for the SAT and literally slept at 8:30 which is the earliest I’ve slept in years
THIS FOUR DAY WEEKEND WAS SO MUCH FUN SO IN GNA DOCUMENT EACH DAY WITH A SEPARATE POST
Anyways on Thursday amelia and I went to get beets and shop and just saying bowls at beets are lowkey so bad
Then we went to see Thomas and Marco and play golf with them
Thomas made fun of my clubs even tho I just found them in my garage and Amelia was bad at golf in the beginning but then got reallllly good towards the middle and it was actually insane bc she could hit as far as the guys
Then we all went to kilwins to get hot chocolate but I can’t have milk so I had to get mine with water which tasted horrible
I also kinda burnt my tongue and it hurt the next day which was weird
And when we were drinking hot chocolate I got this amazing photo of Thomas 🤢But overall a vv fun day!!!!! And my shoulder hurts from playing which is so weird but now I have the form down 😎
Ok so I low key got snap back LMAOOO but I’m not gna be snapping too many ppl back and I stopped streaks n stuff
Anyways yesterday I ran near the reservoir and got some rlly nice views of the trees
I honestly didn’t know where I was going and and ended up at the shop rite in hillsdale but it was a pretty fun run
I ran 7 miles and didn’t realize but I did like a whole loop around Woodcliff lake and park ridge
It was like such a nice temperature to run in yesterday and yea AMAZING RUN
Day 2: I actually didn’t see @ssherryyangg today but I liked this photo and it was fun when we walked in the rain so I wanted to commemorate it with this post
Honestly kinda the same as yesterday but it wasn’t as bad bc I was super busy with work and then I had to take a practice SAT so it was a vv stressful day
I still don’t know what I’m gna be for Halloween or what I’m gna do🎃 sorry if I’m posting sm but if u don’t want to see it u can unfollow
@thomasdewitt__ was such a g and checked up on me which was amazing!! I also want to read a new book so pls comment any recs and if they’re bad I’m never talking to u again jk
Update: screen time is 5 hours so it is cut in half from Tuesday
It’s only day 1 of not having snap and the Snapchat withdrawal is vv bad
I don’t know how what to do besides go on insta which is kind of a problem
Also I feel like my communication was cut in half and I’m still procrastinating just as much as if I did have it so I’ll see if it gets better in a week
Also I’ll be documenting how I’m feeling here
I’ve been wanting to start my podcast but idk with who SO PLEASE LMK of ur interested in talking with me lmao AND ANybody pls text me 😢
Photo dump! I’m getting off snap for awhile so I’ll be posting more here
Some fun stuff I’ve taken/been doing the past few months!! I’m gonna try posting more on here so I can track what I’ve been doing during the past year
quarantine update!
Ok so pretty much I have this photo board in my bedroom and the last time I changed/added photos was when I first got it which was early middle school so it’s been a long time
So this time I wanted to change it to something aesthetically pleasing hehe and this literally took me hourssss but I put together my glossier, brandy Melville, urban outfitters, supreme, palace, and other stickers/merch and got this! Thanks to @soniabalanii and @amelia.jenningss for helping me lmaooo
Ok so anyways I sent my bulletin board to glossier AND THEY RESPONDED which was actually crazy
Also I’ve been FaceTiming Amelia a lot these days and Yao Lao shi wanted to zoom the honors classes in hills AND valley??? It’s was kinda awk tho since I wasn’t expecting that
Another thing that I did was help cut my brothers hair which was a rlly fun experience bc he kept on freaking out if I reacted in any way and also I’ve literally just been changing/cleaning my room so give me ideas on what I should do next!!
Part 2 :((
Currently missing them and this right about now!! I hate quarantine omg I didn’t realize how much I depended on human interaction
Love you guys so much ahhhh 🥺 (Katherine rlly inspired me lmao)
Honestly all I can say is that midterms were not the vibe.
A second a day for a whole year 2019! (Well actually 214 days but same thing)

Now I have to wait another year ughhhh 🥺🥺
Hey film club!
Voted on for the next movie to watch, it is Inglourious Basterds by Quentin Tarintino (another Brad Pitt movie yay)! I will probably have a movie showing this Sunday or Saturday night, and will let you know details for where we are meeting later this week
Hoping for this discussion/movie to be a good one.
Alexis SooHoo
Hey everyone! I’ll be doing a zoom showing of the movie tonight at 8
I’ll send a link later on
Let me know if you can make it!
Hey film club!
After a long hiatus, we are back and ready for another movie! This week's movie will be Fight Club dir
David Fincher
I've always wanted to watch this film, and have held back so I could watch it with the club
I'll probably hold a zoom showing towards the end of the week for this as well
Sorry to keep everyone waiting
Hope everyone can make it to this discussion.
Thanks,
Hey Film Club!
So for this week there isn't going to be a poll but the next movie there will be
We will be watching Jojo Rabbit for the next movie discussion
It was between either this or The Grand Budapest Hotel but I decided on Jojo Rabbit as not as many people have seen it and there possibly can be more discussion over this movie
 The discussion is MONDAY 11/22 in room 243
I'm also going to be holding a movie showing over zoom on Saturday 11/20 at 8:00pm
Anyways here are some details about Jojo Rabbit.
Hope you can make it to the movie showing and discussion! This is the first zoom movie showing we'll have so I would like everyone's input after they attend to see if we can continue zoom virtual meetings or not
And we are looking at Friday, December 17 to be our in person movie watching but nothing is set in stone yet
Have fun watching,
Hey everyone,
Hope you watched Inception for our first film discussion tomorrow!!!!! It will be in the library again for the first half of lunch (11:48)
If the discussion is flowing then we'll see if it should continue into the second half
Also at this meeting we'll discuss what movie we should watch next week and possibly have a zoom watch party for anyone wanting to watch with company
Anyways, hope you all can make it for our first discussion! 
Tuesday's meeting was a great success with a lot of people bringing interesting ideas about Inception
A lot of people really enjoyed the special effects in the movie such as the centrifuge and the scene where the buildings go on top of each other
From the debate of if it was a dream or not a dream, what your totem would be, to if the casting could've been better, it was a successful discussion especially for all that watched the movie
Anyways, here are some points made in Tuesday's discussion! There is no meeting this week, but just to watch the movie
I'll see if I can hold a zoom watch party later in the week
If I can, I will let everyone know
I saw that you filled out the form for the film club and wanted to know more, so I wanted to reach out to you if you had any questions
So far how the club is organized is that there will be a new movie watched every two weeks
The first week everyone will watch a movie through a link to watch it on by yourself, or depending on how everyone else feels we can also watch it together in the school auditorium
Anyways, we watch a movie the first week and the second week we have a discussion
Discussion meeting days will be decided on which days most people can make it and movies are also decided either by me and the club advisor, Mr
Casamento, or by popular vote of the members of the club! This is also a low commitment club since I participate in cross country and track so won't have enough time for a heavy commitment club
Anyways, that’s the layout of the club as of now, can’t wait to see the movie ideas people have
Again, let me know if you have any questions and hope to see you soon!
Thanks so much for joining Pascack Hills Film Club; I’m so excited to see what movie ideas everyone comes up with
There’s going to be the first club meeting on Tuesday 9/28 at 11:02 (aiming for the first half of lunch) in the media center/library
We’ll talk about when the meetings are, how the club works, and more! I'll send out another email later on in the week to remind you and probably the day of
Please email me if you can’t make it or have any questions, and I’ll try and keep it short as I know everybody has plans and places to be
Also if you know anyone who still wants to join or is on the fence about it, tell them to come to the meeting
See you soon! 
Thanks so much,
C was the correct answer but I initially put E thinking that the metaphor of “endangered hatchlings” and the author’s use of like to be positive, telling people to accept it
However, C was correct because the overuse of like especially with serious topics show how it “threatens to eliminate more sophisticated language’ 
At first I thought that “them” referred to B, “the gaps” in the stone wall because the narrator went to go after the gaps in the wall and fix them, but after I realized the work of hunters also added on to the damage of the wall
The correct answer choice was D because the “hunters” were what the narrator came after and “them” came right after the “hunters” meaning they were the subject of the sentence
At first I thought that the simile meant E, “opposing sides in a controversy”, but it actually stood for C, “distinct perspectives of the world”
This answer can be seen “in each hand” as that represents two different perspectives of the neighbors
At first I put E for this question because although Ignatius does seem like he thinks that he’s superior to the average person and his mother, it is only inferred later on in the passage and not in paragraph 1
The correct answer is  C as the narrator presents Ignatius as strange and it can be seen in what the character wears and how he compares his clothing to pedestrians first, showing his priorities
The correct answer would be B rather than C because it doesn’t say anywhere in the passage that he’s had an “extensive education”
It would be B because Ignatius is pretentious because he was using concepts that don’t apply to clothing and everyday life to show how his clothes are more rational than others
The correct answer is A because Ignatius thinks that he is normal and everyone else is not smart and rational like him, this can be seen in the way he dresses
The narrator chooses to highlight that by describing him showing his unusual style
The answer would not be B because there are no “reactions of the people in the crowd around him”
The only events that are happening is Ignatius observing the crowd and the narrator describing what he looks like
I originally chose answer choice D which was, “They each believe their own version of the past is the only correct one.” However, after careful thought I saw why the actual answer was choice A, “They don’t want to disrupt a particular mood”
The evidence for this is how the family members decide to reminisce and not change the subject even after a while
This shows the nostalgic mood wanting to stay the same as each member continues to bring up stories and names of people they once knew
My reasoning behind choice E, “a town characterized by architectural originality,” was because I assumed a town with much architectural diversity meant originality but that was based on assumption rather than using context clues
The answer was D, “a pretentious suburban neighborhood,” as the word choice for “a buffet of overdone tributes” came before the description of homes show the abundance of the impressive architecture of the neighborhood
Also later on the narrator continues to include the mansions surrounding the private stream.
The answer for this question was B, “His feelings of discomfort”
As I continued to read more closely to the passage I saw that as Nathan advanced more into the stream the more uneasy he became to the thought of the exploration such as, “He was disturbed by the aching weirdness of what he was doing” and responded “After five minutes Nathan mumbled”.
In the line, “Sofia didn’t look up to acknowledge Nathan as he walked away” it exemplified how Sofia was easy going unlike Nathan when exploring
Since it is not directly stated that she was returning to the stream the reader is not able to assume “She knows exactly where she is going”
So, instead it seemed that Sofia was comfortable in exploring and in nature or that familiar of an environment
B is the correct answer because the narrator is a third person limited since it tells the thoughts of Corandin
For Coradin he believes that what separates him from the real world and adults and his cousin is his imagination
Through Coradin’s point-of-view we can tell that he tries to seclude himself from Mrs
De Ropp because she doesn’t care to know what Coradin thinks
In his eyes, she seems to believe that the boy is immature and “doesn’t appreciate Conradin’s creative spirit” and “from the realm of his imagination she was locked out” 
The correct answer is B because the beginning of the passage was talking about Conradin and Mrs
De Ropp and how they juxtaposed each other
For Conradin going to the shed and paying a small sum of money shows his independence and getting what he wants without De Ropp finding out
For him it was an act of rebellion and it represented the freedom and independence that he had away from his guardian 
The correct answer is C because the opening of the play shows a man who is mysterious yet tells the plot of the story without trying to trick the audience
As he states he has “a poet’s weakness for symbols” and doesn’t try to directly tell the audience information about the plot but through metaphors, hyperboles, motifs and more
So the narrator is not condescending to the audience and believes the audience will understand his story, but words it carefully so as to not give the “truth” away.
The correct answer is C because after introducing the gentleman caller he is known to be the symbol of a “long-delayed but always expected something that we live for”
This quote means an object or event that people wait to fulfill themselves their whole lifetime and still hope for it all their lives
This is the waiting and fulfillment that the narrator was referring to.
The correct answer is E because the gentleman caller is “from a world of reality that we were somehow set apart from” and Mazatlan was “on the Pacific coast of Mexico” as far away places or people that aren't part of the world the narrator is in
The postcard from Mazatlan was from the narrator's dad who escaped from their family and the gentleman caller was a temporary character, both of which represent escaping from the world they didn’t like
All I can hear is heavy breathing surrounding me, running spikes clashing against the asphalt, and my rugged breathing as I weave through a crowd of familiar colors
Pass the racer on your right, drive your legs through the sand, be careful of tripping on rocks
Simple thoughts that have been with me weekly for the past 3 years
As my breath starts to steady, inhaling and exhaling with cadence, I see a figure drop
As I approach the brown jersey I notice it’s my teammate, she has fainted and a stream of thoughts come flowing in my head
What should I do? Do I stay and wait for an official to come? Have another teammate wait while I retrieve my coach? Or do I keep running? Someone will see her eventually, right? As I saw my friend, who I saw six out of the seven days of the week, I was faced with a decision that was under a time restraint
To stay or to leave
This meant either to give up my chance to personal best and place as a first league champion or not help a friend in need and live with the guilt knowing what I could have done
The latter half of my dilemma was definite
As I stopped to check if she was breathing, four other girls with brown jerseys also followed
First, I shouted to get an official, if there were no coaches around to relay the message I could sprint the half mile back to retrieve one
Second, I checked to see if she was breathing, seeing if there was a noticeable rise and fall of the chest
Third, after about 30 seconds of unconsciousness I saw the opening of eyes
Not having experience in these types of situations, I did what I would want to happen in that position
I was never too close with Austin, but in that moment I made sure all I could do was assure her that she was okay, taking her hand to give stability and looking her in the eyes hoping that she would understand that the team was there for her
All within a span of one minute a race official came to take over and he told us to continue on our race
Going back into the cadence I started developing in the beginning of the race, I finished with a personal record
Yet, I felt frustrated
Mad at myself, my teammate, and at the world
Am I that selfish to have even thought about continuing? Why did this have to happen to me? Tear droplets started to form in my eyes, and when they started flowing my cross country coach went up to me
I explained that for my senior year I wanted a substantial personal record and even though I did, I knew it wasn’t an accurate time since I didn’t know how long I stopped for and if I could have gone faster and if I didn’t have that moment stuck in my head the entire race
The what if’s blurred my mind of the real lessons I learned that day
The biggest one that had an impact on me was that although I was justified to self-pity and feel frustrated, it is better to know that I am capable of doing well, and the next time I race I can come back even stronger
Preparation and confidence were essential
The following lesson my coach told me was “you cannot change the past”, no amount of tears could bring back my choice
And what I had already learned in my time on the cross country team, but solidified my belief in it, was the power of community
I knew that a teammate needed support and I was there to help.
Throughout my childhood my dad made me write in a pink spiral notebook whenever we went on vacation, celebrated a holiday, or even in my day-to-day life
As a rebellious preteen I would only note enough to satisfy him, but never saw the real reason in writing in it
However it turned out I was wrong, and those words only came to fruition when I was cleaning the junk drawer in the office room a few years later and found my writing all the way back from elementary and middle school
Reading how I felt visiting my great Aunt’s new house or how my sixth grade best friend spilled penne vodka all over my new Converse lead up to this revelation: that there is value in remembering the past
 When I got to high school, I joined Cross Country and met new friends and needed a way to cherish the good moments while I was in them
I started my documenting journey with YouTube videos; compiling clips of banter between teammates or sprints to the finish lines, I was able to encapsulate the beginning of my running journey
I went on to record “Friendsgiving” dinners to recapping an entire year of events, making sure to get everything in between
Videos were useful tools in my documenting journey because I could visually and audibly capture the small interactions between friends during freshman year
Seeing how relationships changed, who we still spoke with or who we didn’t speak to at all anymore, gave a sense of nostalgia when looking back
This catalyst to my appreciation of the past led to pieces of paper, but it wasn’t the usual college ruled notebook I started on
Usually when the cashier asks if I would like a receipt my decisions are arbitrary, deciding on whether or not I’m willing to stuff a piece of paper in my bag for the rest of the day
However, after seeing the pile of scrap receipts I had in my nightstand back at home, I knew that behind every crumpled piece of paper was a memory connected to it
From then on I began to write on receipts I obtained while going out
Quick trips to 7-Eleven at 2am, buying New Yorker posters at the Guggenheim, and eating chocolate croissants from my favorite bakery all resulted in snapshots of my life that I could tangibly return to
We take for granted the power journaling has when videos and pictures are at the tip of your fingers, but being able to physically recall a memory to jot down helps solidify the moment especially when it includes the thoughts, descriptions, and feelings of that day
Between all my documentation hobbies such as video recording, journaling, photography, podcasting, creating Spotify playlists and social media, I’ve found receipts to be the most valuable
I view them as a starting point of who I currently am, and as I experience, spend, and write more, I can see how far I’ve come
As it is human nature to evolve and change as time goes on, it is reassuring to know that I have this growth documented
Receipts didn’t require a tutor to learn from or books to read up on to improve, it was all based on how I changed as a person
So, as seasons pass and I face more challenges, there is a receipt to document every part of this journey
And as fall of next year occurs, every purchase I make will represent my first true experience of independence
Opening 
Short sentence: yes, print the receipt i hoard memories 
Active tense/tone 
Understand more about present self by looking back at old self 
Specific receipt 
7/11 after prom 
In order to know who I am now, I need to know who I was in the past 
Snapshots of my life 
Desk drawers filled with 3 year old receipts, unused sandwich bags, journals, letters, and an open mint chocolate Kit Kat wrapper? On the surface it seems that the black desk table situated in the corner of my bedroom is just another collection of clutter that doesn’t have a place in the vast expanse of these four walls, but it is the complete opposite of that, well at least for me
When COVID-19 came and school was shut down, spring of my sophomore year, I returned back to old hobbies, one of which was journaling
Out of watercoloring, crocheting, running, and fantasizing what life would have been like without lockdown, journaling helped me clarify my emotions and thoughts
Taking the time to jot down the goals for the day set a definite direction of what I needed to accomplish
Logging my show marathons of Avatar the Last Airbender or my facetimes with friends made me thankful for the resources I had during quarantine before everything semi-opened back up
The rectangular sheets of paper and cheap ink, although miniscule, are my documentation of my time here on earth
In the vast expanse of the universe, the human race, especially my life, is a blink in the entire spectrum of time
Although I’m not immortal these receipts solidify my existence, my experiences, and my growth
I can see who I’ve become in a series of notes
I write on everything
Whether it’s on sticky notes, college ruled notebook, used ice cream covers, tissues, or even my arm
I write on, in essence, every surface that is allowed to be written on
I mean how could I not remember what it was like to be 11? It's pretty simple to remember who you were as a person because you’ve lived that life
M-O-Y are just three letters that make up my identity
In Cantonese, Mui Mui (姐姐) means little sister or girl, but to me it represents who I am and the person I’ve grown up to be
My parents, brother, and other close relatives call me “Moy'' as a term of affection and endearment
When I changed the official phonetic spelling of Mui to Moy, it showed my Chinese culture being intertwined with my American childhood; I was still called the same nickname, but with a different spelling
This nickname was so ingrained in my mind to the extent where when I was four, I didn’t even know what my birth name was
Then, as I entered pre-school I used my American name
When I was eight, my brother came up to me and told me my grandpa had come to pick us up; it was in front of my classmates
I don’t know why but I felt singled out and even embarrassed when he said “Moy”, maybe because it was the long stares I was given or the confused looks on everyone's face
This was one of the first instances of growing up that I was faced with a feeling of shame to show some part of my Chinese side
When I was twelve, my friends called me Moy after hearing my parents say it a few days before
Although I knew it was meant in good humor, it felt weird to hear a name that is commonly used at home be said out of the mouths of friends who spoke it with laughter
That moment in my life was when I felt the most exposed in who I was
On the weekends, I enjoyed bubble tea, egg tarts, shrimp dumplings, and other Asian cuisines, but when it came to school, I avoided as much as possible to bring any lunches my mom prepared
However, as I have become more self-aware and confident in my own skin, I am able to embrace these foods I was once embarrassed of
If I had to pick a dish to represent who I am, it would be pork dumplings
Every once in a while on the weekend, my family goes to Chinatown to buy groceries for my grandparents and dinner for the following week
When it comes around January to February, my mom and I will make dumplings for Chinese New Year; these pockets of meat and dough represent the fortune to come in the upcoming year
My mom prepares the pork by adding soy sauce, sesame oil, scallion, ginger, and a variety of other seasonings, and while she does that, I then lay out the dumpling skins on a metal pan
After refrigerating the meat, we use ice cream scoopers to place the balls of filling into the middle of the dumpling skins, and then carefully fold each one, sealing it with water
This process brings me closer to my heritage and my mom as I begin to appreciate the steps it takes to create this meal
Similarly to the way this dish connected me to my heritage, the meaning of Moy gradually grew on me
I am finally able to be confident in my skin
For example, my brother’s friends call me Moy, but now it feels endearing and comforting, like how it was as a child
This confidence that my culture gives me is now present in how I approach life, being able to stand for what I believe in and appreciating what I’m given, even if it may not satisfy me at the moment
To me, Moy is now not just a Chinese word, but it’s a word I’ve been able to make into my own.
In Cantonese, 姐姐 means little sister or girl
My family has adopted the traditional phonetic spelling of  “Mui Mui” and changed its written value as “Moy Moy”
My mom, dad, brother, and other direct family all call me by this name, but throughout the years it has taken on new meanings making it more of a nickname to me rather than a traditional title used in Chinese culture
The slight change in phonetic spelling from “Mui” to “Moy” shows the Western influences of punctuation and language.
However, in that same year going into 8th grade I attended a one week Chinese culture sleepaway camp, there I saw people who grew up in the same circumstances as I did, relating to the snide remarks we were told or the awkward 
By then I had been going to Chinese school every Saturday morning for the past 7 years; I participated in cultural performances such as ribbon, fan, and lion dance
I spent almost my whole Saturday dedicated to learning about my ethnicity and yet none of my school friends knew about it
When it came to everyday classes at my Middle School, I felt normal, yet there were always slight instances where I was singled out for my race
It wasn’t out of genuine hate, but more stereotypical comments, and as it was my formative years I spent that time not trying to be unique because of my race
I strove to fit beauty standards that were unrealistic and conformed to the community around me
There had been moments by that age where I would receive the occasional racist comment of eating dogs or slanting their eyes, but not within my close group of friends so I never took it to heart
The moments that lead me here to apply to Babson College, are the moments that created who I am
Curiosity, community, and leadership are the most important lessons that have shaped my personality
What initiated my curiosity was the unknown
To me it was film, art, running, and most importantly business and these all resulted in participating in clubs that aligned with what I wanted to know more about
Eventually I started to join different communities
For business it was DECA, a regional and state competition where I learned valuable life lessons in customer relations and made new friends
And for running, I participated in cross country and track and field
There I created youtube videos to encapsulate the camaraderie I felt with the team
These were my steps to appreciating having a solid community.
I then took these clubs I was in and held leadership positions such as president for business and investment club, founder of the first film club, and historian for track and cross country
All these positions I had were because of the initiative I took to make it happen
I heard of Babson through my super cool cousin Zarvon
To me a college can say a lot about a person, and for him I knew that his school had to be super cool as well
As I looked into Babson College I saw the 100+ clubs and diversified class profile and knew that this represented curiosity, community, and leadership
Hopefully Babson can become my new home and teach me how to be an entrepreneurial leader
The January Enrollment opportunity will give me the chance to focus on projects that I've been interested in doing without the pressure of high school or college work overlapping
With this time off I would join volunteering projects that aim to help to improve either racial justice or environmental issues
Along with volunteering I've had interest in either helping out with local small businesses or even starting my own, selling goods
The January Enrollment also allows more time for me to get acquainted with course material at a more leisurely pace and yet still being introduced to new topics without being overwhelmed
In the past I've only had time to do activities that I enjoy and complete schoolwork, but with this time off I hope to give back to my community
However, being enrolled in the Fall semester won't be an issue since I will still continue to use Babson's resources to volunteer
The only difference is that I will have schoolwork to focus on as well.
Bentley University would be a place where I would be able to grow and learn as a student, not only in academics but as a person
With the school being centered around business programs, I am able to expand my knowledge into any career field but especially somewhere in the sciences
In other universities it is hard to be able to merge two separate types of majors into one but for the Integrated Double Major program I am able to do exactly that
For this program it offers an Earth, Environment, and Global Sustainability major which teaches about economic and societal sustainability and how to apply them to the corporate business world
Then being able to pair my major with a business topic will allow me to pursue both areas of study that I’m interested in
Since Bentley is a business oriented school I am confident in knowing that my two majors will be interchangeable, where unlike other schools it is difficult to merge a science degree with a business degree
When encountering a sexist remark at school, I never knew how to respond
If I spoke up I felt as if the people around me, even women, would think I'm overreacting
However, if I did not, I would go against my moral compass and regret not being able to stand up for myself
Being integrated in a gender-conscious university comforts me in knowing the school is aware of the challenges I may face as a woman in business, but it also makes me aware of how I can deal with them when entering a career field that is majority male
For the Woman Leadership Program, I am interested in the workshops and mentor circles it provides so that I can learn what it's like to be a woman in business
And later on, being able to go on corporate visits will fully immerse myself in the settings that the WLP teaches me about
The tactics to protect myself and skills to work with men will be instilled in my mind and how I present myself in a work setting
Not only can this program help close the gap between females and males in the work setting, but it will also give me leadership skills needed to thrive in any setting
I believe the Women Leadership Program will help boost my confidence
By knowing the impact diversity can have on a work setting and the effects of working in a healthy environment, I can apply these tactics to when I become a leader
What have you learned through your prior involvements (including family responsibilities, part-time jobs, sports, clubs and conferences) that you would hope to further develop in WLP?
In cross country I participated in sports psychology, this was an eight week program where I was able to learn about mental wellness in an athletic setting
For an hour every Thursday night my team members and I would learn about motivators, how mindset impacts performance, visualization, and more, but the topic that stood out to me the most was self-awareness
Self-awareness is being conscious about your actions and feelings and how they affect yourself and others
Sports psychology introduced me to the importance of mental health and how it can impact my running performance
I learned to view the positives, be thankful for where I am, and how to set a positive setting for all the underclassmen
In the Women Leadership Program I hope to apply those same ideals when approaching problems that may arise in my career
This program will improve my self-awareness in a workplace setting and learn how to create a positive experience for other women that may feel suppressed in a work environment
I hope for the WLP to make me aware of the impact of gender consciousness and how to help my colleagues and peers by creating a support system
Another skill I learned in my high school career was my communication and public speaking skills
In DECA, a business roleplay competition I attended, put me in new and, at times, intimidating situations
I had to improvise and quickly formulate plans to present to the judge
These fake business scenarios I was given helped me to think on my feet
I hope that the Women Leadership Program will not also help my self-awareness in a gender conscious environment, but also help my presentation skills
With the final 15 minute presentation at the end of the WLP I can work on my public speaking skills, as well as research
Also for the mentor circles, corporate visits, and conversing with other members in the WLP, I hope to be able to meet new people and work on my communication skills.
As the bright morning sun hits my face and I traverse the black expanse of my driveway, every action that requires the use of energy feels heavy
I open up the red car doors, with paint chipped at the edges and am hit with a fresh cherry scent mixed with a dusty car smell
To others it may seem unappealing, but to me it’s the first taste of relaxing familiarity I have at 7a.m
I toss my gray track bag into the back of the car and tie my laces as she continues on the road
With her brother in the back of the car, and my running sneakers as well, Sherry is my go-to conversation partner
Car rides to school were either filled with a mutual silence or a welcoming banter, such as whether or not we thought the film Lady Bird encapsulated the feelings and experiences we felt as teenage girls
Or if Coldplay or Harry Styles fit the mood of that morning’s ride, there was always a secondary meaning to these conversations
Between the busy school day and even busier extracurriculars, it was our time to bond
Although it can feel like small talk that leads to nowhere, those places to pour my random thoughts felt satisfying and almost therapeutic
In the past I’ve always valued deep conversations more, but over time I saw that simple questions can show just as much about a person.
By observing and focusing enough I noticed that Sherry carefully chose what words to say to convey her opinions, making sure to be effective in communication
And constratingly I speak when I’m thinking, sorting my thoughts in between the words
It helps me see my ideas clearer as they are being put into the cherry scented void
Ultimately I found a tertiary meaning: To take the smaller details into consideration
I take this lesson into the classroom now, sitting back and listening rather than being in the middle of the commotion
By doing this I am able to build a defensible argument during discussions and gather important details during lessons
I also plan to bring this to Boston College exploring new ways to look at religion, learning, and life
Finding my niche in the personalized curriculum that’s meant to navigate who I am
As the bright morning sun hits my face and I traverse the black expanse of my driveway, every action that requires the use of energy feels heavy

With her brother in the back of the car, and my running sneakers as well, Sherry is my go-to conversation partner
Topics of what we did over the weekend, the latest music released, or even the best bubble tea spot, it’s the smallest discussions that have the biggest impact on my days
Car rides to school were either filled with a mutual silence or a welcoming banter
For Sherry it was whether or not we thought the film Lady Bird encapsulated the feelings we felt as teenage girls ourselves
Or if Coldplay or Harry Styles fit the mood of that morning’s ride
Although it can feel like small talk that leads to nowhere, those places to pour my random thoughts felt satisfying and almost therapeutic
 Similar to a book, there is always a secondary meaning behind every conversation
For us, with subtle acknowledgement we knew that it was our time to bond
Between the busy school day and even busier extracurriculars, we take for granted the lighter conversations we have
In the past I’ve always valued deep conversations more, but over time, if I observed and focused enough, I saw that simple questions were just as good, as it can show just as much about a person.
For Sherry I saw that she carefully chose what words to say, to convey her opinions, making sure to be effective in communication
And for me, I saw that I speak as I think, sorting my thoughts in between the words
I take this skill into the classroom now, sitting back and observing rather than being in the middle of the commotion

What excites me most about Boston University are the people
It’s the attitude of the students and staff that are vital in creating an environment to learn
As I toured the Boston University campus, I realized what made me feel energized and eager to learn was the atmosphere of the bustling students around me
I vividly remember standing in the middle of the lobby of George Sherman Union with my family, streamers and banners hanging, and tables full of clubs
That’s when I knew I wanted to be here
Cliche as it is, I know that I’ve been raised in a bubble and I hope that Boston University gives me the opportunity to meet students from all over
More specifically however, in Questrom school of business I am exposed to people from all different backgrounds and personalities, especially with its 48% female population
Through all the diversity, I do also hope to find a unified community
Not through race or social class, but through expertise and ways of thinking
When I think of Questrom I think of articulate, sharp, and proactive students who are led by an impressive and wise staff, all of whom aren’t afraid to take on challenges
That’s why the people are what make this place special; as it encourages me to strive for more than doing well, but by making a difference
And it’s an added plus that the campus keeps sustainability in mind, prioritizes diversity, and has an ever-changing curriculum to fit the current society
I love elephants
They have been my favorite animal as a kid, and still are today
So, when I heard of Tufts and Jumbo the Elephant, I had to look into it
Tufts’ faculty and students encapsulate what it means to be just like their mascot: empathetic, intelligent, and compassionate
And, they like to have fun! Although academically focused, this school also gives their students a chance to have free-time outside of the classroom, not being too burdened by coursework
Tufts aligns with my learning philosophy of growth mindset
Challenging yourself, learning from your mistakes, seeing failure in a positive light all apply to Tufts encouragement of these topics
So now I can finally become an elephant
Not physically of course, but rather that this university can teach me how to be an empathetic, intelligent, and compassionate learner as well
Growing up in a predominantly white school has given me a glimpse of what it’s like to be singled out for your differences, but it was when the Black Lives Matter movement regained momentum again after the tragic death of George Floyd, that I received my first taste of what it looked like to be suppressed
When I was little I feared being mocked about my roots, but then I saw that there were countless minorities that lived in fear of simply existing
This was where I learned sympathy, and although it was a good start, I knew I had more to learn
As COVID-19 hit, it was my first personal experience of being afraid of going out in public
Through the Asian hate crimes happening in New York City, 20 minutes away from home, and even experiencing judgemental stares at the supermarket, was when I gained empathy and truly understood the fear that minorities have lived with their whole lives
After I saw my community being attacked, I attended Asian Hate protests and advocated through my social media pages to see what I could do
To me, I am just at the start of fighting racial injustice, but at home I believe I am not able to use the voice I have to speak out about other communities
That’s why at Tufts I hope to deeply be involved in racial and social injustice awareness, as I feel supported and free in what I believe.
Going every Sunday morning to Chinatown to buy groceries with my grandparents to thrifting near Washington Square Park with my friends, I learned the basics of becoming a New Yorker
By observing my surroundings I was able to navigate the subway lines and pace my strides with other pedestrians, making sure to always stay on the right side of the sidewalk
So, by studying in New York City I’ll be able to take my knowledge and build it further, maybe even becoming an expert from downtown to midtown to all around
This closely reflects my goals to study at New York University as just knowing the basics of investing in the stock market or making a simple balance sheet are not sufficient enough to achieve my goals; I need to expand this knowledge
For the BS in Business, Technology, and Entrepreneurship major, I am able to do just that
To me, a business major isn’t made up of just accounting or finance, but it’s a combination of different skills that all eventually end up intertwining
That’s why being a BTE student will help me thrive in a business setting because when it comes to my experience and education, I won’t just have learned business fundamentals but I’ll also have a liberal arts and STEM related background, giving me an edge on my competitors
Going along with having multiple majors and minors available to me, NYU allows current Stern students to pursue a dual degree, one of which is the BS in Business/BFA in Film and Television
This allows me to explore my numerous interests and my passions for the business world and the entertainment industry, letting my experience I’ve received in high school, with my film club, translate to real world career opportunities.
Besides the BS in BTE major, climate change and sustainability are social issues that resonate with me, so NYU’s Climate Change Initiative and Office of Sustainability are important to me as the university’s goals for a cleaner and greener lifestyle give me comfort in knowing that the school is striving to reduce their carbon footprint and spread awareness about this topic
At NYU I intend to attend conferences that are held through the Climate Change Initiative and join sustainability clubs in order to make myself aware of the current climate and further my knowledge about the environment, even if it may not pertain to my major
For example, the NYU Office of Global Inclusion helps to strengthen policies for minorities and provide leadership and that can be seen in the diversity make up of each class
Seeing the care New York University shows for its students, by giving them the right resources to succeed, comforts me in knowing that the school is there for its students academically and overall
By studying here I am confident that I’ll be able to meet individuals with the same work ethic and goals but with different backgrounds, learning outside of the bubble I was brought up in.
When walking on the campus I felt the vibrance surrounding me, and eventually I noticed it was the people who made it that way
Walking through bustling crowds it was the innovative students, welcoming staff, and captivating presentation speakers that made me feel motivated to pursue a higher education here
My favorite thing from the Wellesley 100 is “The limitlessness of educational options” and it’s because of the opportunities I’m given to explore different learning styles across different schools
From Olin, a small school of just 310 people, and MIT, a larger school of just over 4,000, Wellesley will open my eyes to the vast spectrum of curriculums, more specifically my favorite, gathering different ideas for one common goal
I’m also interested in the cross-registration of different schools, as I know I’ll meet numerous other professors and students, that will eventually help me thrive in Wellesley’s academic setting
This would be an added bonus in my academic career as I will have taken courses from 2 or more amazing schools, and meeting students that can share their knowledge with me
Although I am unsure if I will be doing a dual-degree program, it makes me feel secure in knowing that I have the decision to be able to cross-register with different Boston schools
And, not as academically focused, but another favorite of the Wellesley 100 is the ability to become a part-time botanista! As an amateur plant enthusiast, I feel like taking part in the Wellesley College Botanic Gardens will up my experience in plant knowledge and collecting
Back at home I’ve only dipped my feet in succulents, but at this school I hope to widen this experience and be able to apply it to my major
What intrigues me the most about plants is that they can only thrive under close observation and care; I hope to take these skills into the classroom when carrying out research and just learning in general
Learning more about plants, teaches me more about science and life, understanding the chemistry and biology behind raising plants in certain conditions, and learning the patience it takes to care for a plant
As of now, I don’t have the time or resources to do this, but by joining student groups dedicated to just planting and farming, I will definitely be joining these clubs
I applied to Northwestern University on a bet
Two years ago my friend Matt was rejected from this school, and insensitively I mocked him
He replied with, “I bet you $20 you don’t make it in, and if you do, I’ll pay you $100” and being a senseless proposition, I agreed
As college applications approach and the impending $20 most likely due, I still decided to give this school a try and look into it
That’s why I chose the Radio/TV/Film Major because as I looked into Northwestern’s programs I saw how unique it was compared to other film programs
I saw how much culture was infused with the curriculum, and not because it’s a major centered around pop culture, but how it goes in depth with everything revolving around film, television, and radio
I also liked the interdisciplinary taught with this major; I am not just being set up as a communications major but also am versatile in other fields
Although for other schools I’m planning on going as a business major, choosing film as my major for Northwestern is my other bet, but with myself
As a child I loved movies, especially the cliche rom-coms like 10 Things I Hate About You
That’s why I started a film club at school, to find a way to express my love for the art
Whether it be set design, screenwriting, or cinematography, it has been a part of my life no matter how old I get; it’s a return to my childhood, where imagination runs wild
This gamble is to prove that dreams can come to a reality
An opportunity to apply, and even study, at a top school in the world with a curriculum that teaches film history to media analysis, doesn’t come around often
 For most of my other schools I am applying as a business student, but my choice for applying as a Radio/TV/Film major is only because  I take this application as a reach into the void, a representation of a dream that’s in a distant world
